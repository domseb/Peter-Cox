      <h3>Profile</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          His professional career began in the early 2000â€™s specifically in the
          area of addictions, but developed from here to include a deep and
          far-reaching interest in all of the ways in which people either
          thrive, or fail to thrive and become stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          I/he has written, presented, and facilitated workshops to audiences in
          Australia and Europe on various topics relating to the pursuit of
          human flourishing.

      <h3>Focus</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I work with people of all ages from late-adolescence onwards, and
          offer both short and long-term approaches in modalities that include
          counselling, psychotherapy, and clinical supervision. I offer both
          in-person and online services. My focus is on working in depth to help
          people resolve underlying dysfunctional patterns of thought, emotion,
          and behaviour, and to help people in becoming the fullest and best
          version of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The surface manifestation of dysfunctional patterns vary greatly and
          include addictions, depression/dysphoria, anxiety,
          obsessive-compulsive tendencies, repetitive relationship difficulties,
          eating disorders, sexuality-based issues, identity confusion, and a
          general lack of meaning in life.
