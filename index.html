<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  His professional career began in the early 2000â€™s specifically in the area of
  addictions, but developed from here to include a deep and far-reaching
  interest in all of the ways in which people either thrive, or fail to thrive
  and become stuck.
</p>
<p>
  I/he has written, presented, and facilitated workshops to audiences in
  Australia and Europe on various topics relating to the pursuit of human
  flourishing.
</p>

<h3>Areas of focus</h3>
<p>
  I work with people of all ages from late-adolescence onwards, and offer both
  short and long-term approaches in modalities that include counselling,
  psychotherapy, and clinical supervision. I offer both in-person and online
  services. My focus is on working in depth to help people resolve underlying
  dysfunctional patterns of thought, emotion, and behaviour, and to help people
  in becoming the fullest and best version of themselves.
</p>
<p>
  The surface manifestation of dysfunctional patterns vary greatly and include
  addictions, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive tendencies,
  repetitive relationship difficulties, eating disorders, sexuality-based
  issues, identity confusion, and a general lack of meaning in life.
